- 👋 Hi, I’m @anthonyb-bboss
- 👀 I’m interested in all things relating to the concept of software design strategy. So this would be things like how software is constructed, improved and maintained - irrespective of the actual implemented tech (though my preferred tech is Laravel/PHP). 
- 🌱 I’m always learning! I'm currently learning to solve a 4x4 rubix cube
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything Laravel-related with the team at BBOSS Ltd
- 😄 Pronouns: Standard He/Him though Him/Legend would work too
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can (and have witnessess to confirm) solve a 3x3 rubix cube in under 2 mins
